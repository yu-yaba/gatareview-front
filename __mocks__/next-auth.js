// Mock the default export (NextAuth function)
const NextAuth = jest.fn((options) => {
  // This mock should return what the NextAuth() function call is expected to return,
  // which is typically a handler function or an object with handler methods.
  // For the purpose of testing components that import authOptions,
  // we might not need a fully functional NextAuth handler.
  // If authOptions itself is what's important, this mock might not even be hit
  // unless the instantiation `NextAuth(authOptions)` is problematic.

  // Let's assume it returns a generic handler for GET/POST for now.
  const handler = (req, res) => {
    // A simple mock handler
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Mocked NextAuth handler' });
  };
  return handler; // Or return { GET: handler, POST: handler } if that's the structure
});

export default NextAuth;

// If there are other named exports from 'next-auth' that are used and need mocking:
// export const someNamedExport = jest.fn();
